# Creating-Dashboards-Using-Google-Looker-Studio
This repository showcases my work in utilizing Google Looker Studio to create interactive dashboards for analyzing sales and service metrics in a car dealership chain. I independently designed and implemented these dashboards, leveraging data visualization techniques to gain valuable insights.

Project Overview
In this project, I:

Utilized Google Looker Studio to design and develop comprehensive dashboards.
Analyzed and visualized key data points from the IBM Accelerator Catalog dataset.
Connected and processed the dataset via Google Sheets and Looker Studio to present actionable insights.
Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from the IBM Accelerator Catalog and modified to suit the project requirements. All files were imported into Google Sheets and connected with Looker Studio for seamless data integration.

Dashboard Design and Execution
Sales Dashboard
Designed a Sales Dashboard on the first page using a layout with 5 distinct visualizations.
Renamed the first page to Sales.
Captured KPIs:
Panel 1: Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of USD).
Panel 2: Quantity sold.
Panel 3: Quantity sold by model (visualized as a bar chart).
Panel 4: Average quantity sold.
Panel 5: Profit by Dealer ID (displayed as a column chart, sorted in ascending order).
Service Dashboard
Designed a Service Dashboard on the second page using a layout with 4 distinct visualizations.
Renamed the second page to Service.
Captured KPIs:
Panel 1 (Top Left): Number of recalls per car model (as a column chart).
Panel 2 (Top Right): Customer sentiment (visualized as a treemap comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews).
Panel 3 (Bottom Left): Quantity of cars sold per month compared to profit (visualized as a combo chart with line and bar elements).
Panel 4 (Bottom Right): Number of recalls by model and affected system (visualized as a pivot table with a heatmap to identify outliers).
Exported Dashboards
Exported the dashboards as PDFs via Looker Studioâ€™s Download report functionality.
Included suitable titles, x and y-axis labels, and filters for enhanced presentation.
Key Outcomes
Through this project, I:

Mastered the creation of professional-quality dashboards using Google Looker Studio.
Transformed raw data into meaningful visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.
Developed and presented dashboards tailored to analyzing sales and service operations.
Delivered polished PDF exports for documentation and review.
This repository demonstrates my proficiency in data visualization and dashboard creation, showcasing my ability to work independently and deliver impactful insights for real-world scenarios.
